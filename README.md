# 🎬✨ Netflix EDA: Unmasking the Streaming Empire ✨📊

> **Project Motto:** _"We don’t just stream shows — we stream insights."_  
> Buckle up, because we’re about to serve data analysis hotter than a season finale cliffhanger. This project dives deep into Netflix’s catalogue to uncover what makes it tick, click, and stick. 📈🍿

---

## 📦 Dataset Details

We used the **Netflix Titles Dataset** — a delicious compilation of metadata for TV Shows and Movies available on Netflix, featuring:

- Title  
- Type (Movie or TV Show)  
- Cast & Crew  
- Country of origin  
- Date added to Netflix  
- Release Year  
- Duration  
- Genres (aka `listed_in`)  
- Description  
...and more streaming goodness.

Imported like:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('netflix_titles.csv')
```
## 🧼 Act I: Cleaning the Scene (aka Data Cleaning)

Every great drama needs a clean script. So we:

- Checked for missing data using `.isnull().sum()` ✅  
- Investigated data types with `.info()` and `.describe()` 🔍  
- Removed rows with missing crucial values (like `title`, `type`, or listed genres) — resulting in **less than 0.2% data loss** (aka barely a scratch 💅)

## 📊 Act II: Lights, Camera, Visualize! (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Let the graphs do the talking! Here’s what we investigated:

### 🎭 Movie vs TV Show: Who’s Winning the War?

We grouped by the `type` column and visualized the split in a **pie chart** to reveal the eternal tug of war between TV shows and Movies.

> Spoiler: Movies are still Netflix's main squeeze, but TV shows are gaining serious traction 👀

---

### 📅 Release Year Trend: Is Netflix Getting Older or Wiser?

We plotted the **release year distribution** to see how content evolved over time.

> Major finding: Most content comes post-2000s — peaking around 2017–2019. Nostalgia sells, but fresh is fierce.

---

### 🌍 Top Countries of Origin

We grouped by `country` and visualized the top contributors of Netflix content.

> USA dominates (duh), but India, UK, and Canada are rising players on the content chessboard.

---

### 🕵️‍♀️ Director & Cast Stats

We peeked into who’s behind the screen — examining the most frequent **directors** and **actors** gracing our queues.

> Most common director? The true workhorse of Netflix.  
> Most frequent actor? Basically lives in your 'Continue Watching' row.

---

### ⏰ Duration Analysis

We looked into the `duration` column to compare how long Movies and TV Shows really are.

> 🧠 Fun Fact: TV Shows don't list minutes — they list seasons. We analyzed those separately for spicy insights.

---

### 🎨 Genre Breakdown — The Real Star of the Show

Here’s where we had to go all-out:

1. The `listed_in` column was a **chaotic comma-separated mess** of genres. So…  
2. We split it into a list → stripped whitespace → exploded it into individual rows (like a genre buffet) 🍿  
3. Then we used `.value_counts()` to rank the **Top 10 Most Popular Genres**

> 💥 Boom: The genre game is *stacked* — Drama, International TV Shows, and Documentaries rule the throne.

---

## 🔮 Final Takeaways

- 🎬 **Movies still rule**, but TV Shows are rising — especially internationally.  
- 🌏 Netflix is becoming more global — watch out for Korean, Indian, and European titles.  
- 🎭 **Drama is king**, but don't sleep on Reality TV and Crime thrillers (the bingers' favorite).  
- 🎯 Netflix knows its audience — the content skew makes it clear: short attention spans love fast-moving plots and diverse formats.

## 🧠 Reflections

This EDA wasn't just a look at Netflix — it was a lens into **content strategy, globalization, and viewer psychology.**  
If data had a genre, this analysis would be a suspense-thriller-meets-romcom.

Next step? Turn this into an interactive dashboard. Or train a rec system. Or… pitch to Netflix? 👀
